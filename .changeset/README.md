# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

for commiting use correct message format
e.g. git commit -m "feat: added feature one"

then run

yarn changeset

this will create a changeset file in the .changeset folder

then run

yarn gen-changelog

then commit files with

git commit -m "chore: version release"
